We offer a range of open-source libraries and tools to aid in research and development in the field of [Knowledge-Based Configuration Systems].

This site provides the documentation of the following Java library and apps:

1. [hiconfit-core]
2. [KBStatistics]
3. [FMGen]

To use **hiconfit-core**, please first follow the guide in [Get libraries].

## Used by

**hiconfit-core** are used by the following projects:

1. [FMTesting] - A Eclipse plug-in for feature model testing and debugging
2. A Python implementation of **hiconfit-core**'s algorithms can be found in [FlamaPy]
3. A Restful Webservice for developing product configurators with the following state-of-art technologies:
    - Domain reduction - decreases options that a user can select on the basis of previous selections of the user
    - Matrix Factorization-based Configuration and Recommendation - identifies Value Variable Heuristics on the basis of user requirements
    - Reordering the order of component's options on the basis of the Value Variable Heuristic
    - Conflict and diagnosis detection

and also used in the following published papers:
